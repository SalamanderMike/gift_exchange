#The Gift Exchange

##Overview
The Gift Exchange is an app designed to facilitate gift exchanges between groups of people such as friends, family, and business teams.

##Motivation
I was inspired to build this app from dialog between friends and acquaintances who found gift exchanges less than fun due to the lack of relevant knowledge of participants' likes and dislikes of their gift receiver/giver. I love gifting and generosity! I want the experience to be as fun as it should be! Thus, my app.

##Usage
* Sign up! 
* Create a group! 
* Set the number of participants to join the group and the spending limit on the gifts. 
* Tell your participants to sign up, joining your group, and fill out their profile outlining their favorite things.
* Let the app match people up randomly and show their giver the profile of the receiver.
* If you want, let the app choose some gift ideas based on the profile of the receiver and show results as Amazon.com, Etsy, eBay items, or Yelp! reviews.

##Built With
* Node.js
* Express
